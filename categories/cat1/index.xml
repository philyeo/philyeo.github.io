      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it. It&amp;rsquo;s been so long since I actually written to any blogs. I use to have lots of them and write quite regularly to some. They were primarily on Wordpress and Blogspot. But that was over more than a decade ago.
So you can only imagine how outdated I am with all of this. And after going through some articles and youtube videos, I stumbled upon Scott Hanselman&amp;rsquo;s video about starting a static webpage with Azure at no cost.</description>

      <description>This is not my first blog. Iâ€™ve had many in the past. But I figured I want to start fresh. My attempt is to record my thoughts and also my journey to re-educate myself with the latest technology. Stay tuned.</description>
